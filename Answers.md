1. lists are less complex to use in this case because when given n for the size of the list or array, with a list the values
can be added as you go on top of each other and the size does not have to be initially declared unlike an array which needs
to be pre-allocated. 
2. If the array is not sorted in the case of binary search, the program could skip over and miss a portion of the array
that is being looked for and return not found.
3. The validity checking for constructors is done to check if the value is null or not, and if it is it will throw
an illegal argument exception.
4. the purpose of final variables are to clearly show intent with variables and methods and once they are declared final
they cannot overridden or have their values changed
5. Instead of using optional, you could keep using nested checks for a null reference. The problem with that compared to 
Optional is that continuously checking for null values would quickly get clunky and hard to read and take up more memory.
